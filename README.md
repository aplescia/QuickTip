A simple tip calculator written in Swift for iOS 8.

The goal of QuickTip is to create a Tip Calculator without all the unnecessary and/or confusing bells and whistles. While most Tip Calculators
on the app store today incorporate a ton of intrusive, and often unused functions, QuickTip will provide a simple interface with an extremely 
quick way to obtain a tip of whatever bill you're currently paying.
